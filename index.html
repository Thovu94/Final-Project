Since it was created, it has rapiddly become major trends for web development. Due to its priorities, JavaScipt is one of the three things someone should learn if he/she want to become a front-end developer. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. For example:
                <pre class=" bg-dark">var person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName : "Doe",
        id       : 5566,
        fullName : function() {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}

After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a simple scripting language used in Sass files. Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax", uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS" (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively. One of the things I have learnt in Sass is how to do with <code>@mixin</code> as well as <code>variables, @expend, @include</code> </div>

The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. HTML5 is a very powerful tool for web developer to build a stunning website. At first, it seems to me that it is difficult to lear, but then I realize that it is more challenging than my expectation. As the saying goes:

CSS3 is the latest version, which brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. For beginners, starting with CSS is not a comfortable feeling. However after a handful of assignments, learners can be farmiliar with CSS. With CSS3, as a developer we can do a multiple things

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community. This is one of typical examples. The example below runs a program to find the area of a circle.
                <pre class=" bg-dark">    pi= 3.14
    r= input("enter the radius here ")
    r=float(r)
    A= pi*r**2
    print("Area of a cicle",A)

</pre>
                One of the best ways to learn Python is analyze the example, start doing the assignment and learn from mistakes. Then we should try to compare our code with the solution in the textbook. </div>
